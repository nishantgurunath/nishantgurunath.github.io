I am an applied scientist and engineer specializing in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) at Moody's Analytics. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where I focused on machine learning. At my core, I am driven by a passion for problem-solving and making a positive impact through technology. My fascination with machine learning stems from its transformative potential to address fundamental challenges, coupled with my probabilistic worldview. I enjoy discovering patterns in data, extracting valuable insights, and drawing meaningful inferences—interests that naturally led me to NLP, a field brimming with opportunities in unstructured text data.  

At Moody's Analytics, I apply NLP across diverse domains, including:  
1. **Know Your Customer (KYC):** Enhancing risk detection for high-risk entities.  
2. **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG):** Assessing corporate ESG risks and identifying improvement areas.  
3. **Commercial Real Estate (CRE):** Creating analytical tools for market research and investment.  
4. **Sales Recommendations:** Driving business growth through tailored recommendations.  

I have developed models and systems for entity matching, risk profiling, information extraction, data enrichment, and recommendation engines. My expertise includes techniques like named entity recognition, keyphrase extraction, text classification, retrieval and ranking, duplicate detection, and zero-shot classification. I am particularly focused on model governance and explainability, ensuring practical and ethical application in real-world scenarios.  

Recently, I have been at the forefront of leveraging AI agents for compliance and screening. I developed the **AI Screening Agent**, a groundbreaking solution for automating Level 1 (L1) screening workflows in KYC and compliance. This system aims to minimize false positives, significantly reducing human review time and cost. Going beyond traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications like summarization and chat-with-your-data (CWYD), the AI Screening Agent introduces a novel architecture with distributed intelligence, enabling it to perform complex compliance decision-making with accuracy comparable to human analysts.

Beyond machine learning, I am passionate about optimizing engineering solutions for seamless deployment. I have extensive experience in system architecture, building ML-NLP pipelines, deploying microservices, and creating APIs.  

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, playing tennis and ping-pong, working out, and exploring the piano—a hobby I picked up during the pandemic.
